Library Database Management System
</br>
===================================
An online library management system is user-friendly for assigning books and viewing the many books and topics accessible under a category.
The C# programming language simplifies creating this kind of management information system (MIS). 
Additionally, rapid information retrieval is possible with SQL commands.
Consider your college library, where lecturers and students can check books out. 
Typically, both groups have different deadlines for returning the book, ranging from a few days to a few weeks.
Additionally, although they may be identical copies of the same book written by the same author, each has a separate ID. 
This means that every book in a library management system contains an entry that details who issued it, how long it was on loan, how much any fines came to, and other helpful information.
